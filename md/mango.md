During my industrial placement at Mango Studios, I supported both technical and client facing work within a small team.

I communicated with potential clients to present the company’s products, gaining experience in explaining ideas clearly and professionally. I also helped install and troubleshoot hardware devices to improve day to day productivity for the team. I also took on a leadership role when needed, helping coordinate tasks so the team could meet project requirements on time.
