During my first year of college, I took part in the World Skills Competition which tested me on real world systems administration, networking and problem solving abilities using both Windows and Linux environments.

At that time, I had limited prior experience with Linux environments and other tools involved which meant I often had to work things out as I went. I was able to complete many of the system configuration tasks like disk management and partitions, and I was able to use a mix of terminal and graphical user interfaces to attempt to diagnose several issues.

While I did not have a full understanding of all the technologies involved, I am glad to have participated as it pointed out various gaps in my knowledge which helped me improve in those areas.

## Key skills
- Problem solving under pressure
- Basic systems configuration
- Following technical instructions
- Determination

## Technologies
- Windows
- Disk management tools
- Hyper-V
