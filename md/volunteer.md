During my second year of university, I decided to volunteer at New Scientists Live on behalf of my university to help demonstrate our Niryo robot arms. 

As a volunteer I spoke with attendees of all ages and answered their various questions throughout the event, explained simple computer science concepts and helped troubleshoot issues with the robot arms during demonstrations. This experience helped me improve my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly while working under the pressure of a live exhibition environment.

## Key skills
- Problem-solving under pressure
- Technical communication
- Public engagement
- Troubleshooting

Here's me at the event.
