During my time in college, I worked as a <span class="blue">computer science tutor</span> and taught my students <span class="blue">core programming concepts</span> using <span class="blue">Python</span>. I would improve their <span class="blue">coding</span> and <span class="blue">debugging abilities</span> through different practical exercises and helped them <span class="blue">create a game</span> using the <span class="blue">Pygame</span> library.

## Key skills
- Python (+ Pygame library)
- Time management
- Communication
- Adaptability
- Debugging

Have a look at some images of the things we were able to create.
