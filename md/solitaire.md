This project was a university assignment where I made a solitaire website using <span class="blue">HTML/CSS</span> and <span class="blue">JavaScript</span>.

This was the first project in our module and for the final project we were expected to produce a website with a functional <span class="blue">login/registration</span> system using <span class="blue">local storage</span> and <span class="blue">session storage</span> and then to have a <span class="blue">game with a <span class="blue">leaderboards system</span>.

I decided to create a solitaire game as it was a good way to practice my <span class="blue">JavaScript skills</span>. By the end of the project I was able to create the game with a <span class="blue">leaderboards system</span> but my solitaire has quite a few bugs and is close to impossible to beat. Also the leaderboards system is lacking at best as it only really displays users that are in session storage and thats about it.

## Technologies used

Here are some images of the website.
