As part of a Digital Skills project, I worked in a small team to demonstrate a solution to one of the 4 tasks that where given. With that we were expected to produce a powerpoint containing our ideas and a possible prototype of our solution.

We decided to make a game which would tackle the task of climate change. I contributed by communicating ideas with the team, helping plan the structure of the prototype, and created a part of the prototype to use for demonstration purposes. Where needed, I researched unfamiliar technologies and approaches and applied them to improve the project outcome.

This project helped me develop my teamwork, problem-solving, and ability to quickly learn new tools while working towards a shared goal.
