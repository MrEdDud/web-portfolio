# Turning an old computer into a server
<br>

I decided to turn an old PC into a server to learn more about Linux. I used CasaOS so that I could remotely access my server and I have used it to host Minecraft servers.

I first got the PC and removed a lot of the excess space that I could. To do this I had to remove the power button from the motherboard, where I then had to find a datasheet online for that motherboard to figure out how to plug the button back in correctly (image is below). Then I built a case out of wood for it.

Now for the software. I used debian 12 with CasaOS and the install was mostly smooth and simple except for one error which I had. After that I booted up into CasaOS from my computer after putting in the username and password, installed the necessary software to run a minecraft server, activated port forwarding and then used the server.

Im glad that I did a small project like this because it was my first proper introduction to Linux and really helped me understand very basic terminal commands and also taught me the skills to research online effectively and solving problems that I faced.

Have a look at the pictures I have.
