# Social media website - Relax
<br>

This project was a university assignment where I made a social media website using <span class="blue">Node.js</span> with <span class="blue">Express</span> and <span class="blue">MongoDB</span>.

For this project I was able to create a <span class="blue">social media website</span> with a functioning <span class="blue">login/registration</span> system, a working <span class="blue">feed page</span> where users can view the content of users they follow, a <span class="blue">posting content system</span>, a <span class="blue">following system</span> and an <span class="blue">AI chatbot</span> all with correct <span class="blue">error messages</span> on each page.

Currently, its still in the process of being graded so I will not be sharing a live link to it.
